## COVID Tracker

I decided to go ride the 'bleeding edge' and use Vite + Vue3 + Vuex4.

Spend about 6 hours, so a little more than was suggested.

Some findings:

- The API has some weird things, like: sometimes the Deaths or Confirmed is not returned as 0 if there are no results.
- Implementing unit tests on Vue3 was a lot harder than I expected.
- Spend a long time on the Country selector. Basically its a combination of a long list with typeahead search functionality.
- Did not spend too much time on the layout and making it nicer, because I ran out of time.

Looking forward to talk about my solutions, implementations and improvements.
